       " 'text': 'In 1878, Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil-based lighting. He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, something that would be needed for indoor use. However, Thomas Edison did\\nnot invent the light bulb. In 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue developed an efficient light bulb using a coiled platinum filament but the high cost of platinum kept the bulb from becoming a commercial success. Many other inventors had also devised incandescent lamps,\\nincluding Alessandro Volta\\'s demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer, William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich Göbel.\\nThese early bulbs all had flaws such as an extremely short life and requiring a high electric current to operate which made them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially.: 217–218 In his first attempts to solve these problems, Edison tried\\nusing a filament made of cardboard, carbonized with compressed lampblack. This burnt out too quickly to provide lasting light. He then experimented with different grasses and canes such as hemp, and palmetto, before settling on bamboo as the best filament. Edison continued\\ntrying to improve this design and on November 4, 1879, filed for U.S. patent 223,898 (granted on January 27, 1880) for an electric lamp using \"a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires\".The patent described several ways of\\ncreating the carbon filament including \"cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways\". It was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last over 1,200\\nhours.\\nIn 1878, Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers, including J. P. Morgan, Spencer Trask, and the members of the Vanderbilt family. Edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on December 31, 1879, in Menlo Park. It was during this time that he said: \"We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles.\"\\nHenry Villard, president of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company, attended Edison\\'s 1879 demonstration. Villard was impressed and requested Edison install his electric lighting system aboard Villard\\'s company\\'s new steamer, the Columbia. Although hesitant at first, Edison agreed to Villard\\'s request. Most of the',\n",
